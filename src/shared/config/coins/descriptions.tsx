    [$const.ADA]: <div>
        <p>
            Cardano is a third-generation, decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform designed to be a
            more efficient alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) networks. 
            Scalability, interoperability, and sustainability on PoW networks are limited by the 
            infrastructure burden of growing costs, energy use, and slow transaction times.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain Ethereum, understood the
            implications of these challenges to blockchain networks, and began developing Cardano and its primary
            cryptocurrency, ada, in 2015, launching the platform and the ADA token in 2017.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Cardano is a blockchain platform that aims to be a decentralized application (DApp) development platform
            with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.
            Cardano is being built in five stages: foundation, decentralization, smart contracts, scaling, and
            governance.
            Cardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol and developments are informed by
            scholarly academic research. The primary cryptocurrency of Cardano is called "ada".
            Cardano oversight is decentralized and shared by The Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and EMURGO.

            ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token used within the APE Ecosystem to empower and
            incentivize a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ApeCoin holders govern themselves via the decentralized governance framework controlling the ApeCoin DAO,
            and vote on how the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem Fund should be used. The APE Foundation administers proposals
            agreed upon by ApeCoin holders.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ApeCoin is the APE Ecosystem’s governance token, allowing token holders to participate in ApeCoin DAO and
            giving its participants a shared and open currency that can be used without centralized intermediaries.
            62% of all ApeCoin was allocated to the Ecosystem Fund, 
            which will support community-driven initiatives as voted on by ApeCoin DAO members.
        </p>
        <br/>

    [$const.ATOM]: <div>
        <p>
            Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos,
            blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could
            only handle a small amount of transactions per second. 
            Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Cosmos (ATOM) is a cryptocurrency that powers an ecosystem of blockchains designed to scale and
            interoperate with each other. The team aims to "create an Internet of Blockchains, 
            a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way." 
            Cosmos is a proof-of-stake chain. ATOM holders can stake their tokens in order to 
            maintain the network and receive more ATOM as a reward.

    </div>,

    [$const.AVAX]: <div>
        <p>
            Avalanche (AVAX) is a cryptocurrency and blockchain platform that rivals Ethereum. AVAX is the native
            token of the Avalanche blockchain, which—like Ethereum—uses smart 
            contracts to support a variety of blockchain projects.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Avalanche blockchain can provide near-instant transaction finality. AVAX is used to pay transaction
            processing fees and secure the Avalanche network, and acts as a basic unit of account among blockchains
            in the Avalanche network. Transaction fees and the rate of AVAX coin creation are determined using a
            governance model.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Avalanche is a competitor to Ethereum that prioritizes scalability and transaction processing speed.

    </div>,

    [$const.BCH]: <div>
        <p>
            Bitcoin Cash BCH holds an important place in the history of altcoins because it is one of the 
            earliest and most successful hard forks of the original Bitcoin. 
            In the cryptocurrency world, a fork takes place as the result of debates and arguments between 
            developers and miners. Due to the decentralized nature of digital currencies, 
            wholesale changes to the code underlying the token or coin at hand must be made due to
            general consensus; the mechanism for this process varies according to the particular cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            When different factions can’t agree, sometimes the digital currency is split, with the original chain
            remaining true to its original code and the new chain beginning life as 
            a new version of the prior coin, complete with changes to its code.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            BCH began its life in August 2017 as a result of one of these splits. The debate that led to 
            the creation of BCH had to do with the issue of scalability; the Bitcoin network has 
            a limit on the size of blocks: 1 megabyte (MB). BCH increases the block size from 1MB to 8MBs, 
            with the idea being that larger blocks can hold more transactions within them, and 
            the transaction speed would therefore increase. It also makes other changes, 
            including the removal of the Segregated Witness protocol that impacts block space.

    [$const.BNB]: <div>
        <p>
            Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by the Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own
            blockchain, the Binance chain.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy, or "burn,"
            Binance coins held in its treasury.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Binance was created as a utility token for discounted trading fees in 2017, but its uses have expanded to
            numerous applications, including payments for transaction fees (on the Binance Chain), travel bookings,
            entertainment, online services, and financial services.

    [$const.BTC]: <div>
        <p>
            The world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is stored and exchanged securely on 
            the Internet through the digital ledger known as the blockchain.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The value of bitcoin is formed by several factors:
        </p>
        <ul className='pl-[25px] list-disc'>
            <li>The ideology of cryptocurrency creation is independence from the state.</li>
            <li>The demand for bitcoin is increasing and the number of released coins is gradually decreasing.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin emission is limited to 21,000,000 coins. No more can be created.</li>
            <li>Mining of coins requires labor, computing resources, and electricity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>,

    [$const.DAI]: <div>
        <p>
            The Dai stablecoin uses a basket of crypto assets as collateral at a ratio of 150% to the value of its
            tokens. It is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms, and is supported on 
            Ethereum and other popular blockchains.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Dai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker
            Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access
            to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a
            means of payment.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Once generated, bought, or received, Dai can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it
            can be sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, and even held as savings through a feature
            of the Maker Protocol called the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Every Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the
            collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions 
            are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.

            Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency started in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Dogecoin initially started as a joke based on a popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu 
            (a Japanese breed of dog).
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It is based on Litecoin and uses the same proof-of-work technology.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Dogecoin has a loyal community of supporters who trade it and use it as a tipping currency for social
            media content.

    [$const.DOT]: <div>
        <p>
            Polkadot (DOT) is a unique PoS cryptocurrency aimed at delivering interoperability among other
            blockchains. Its protocol is designed to connect permissioned and permissionless blockchains 
            as well as oracles to allow systems to work together under one roof. Polkadot’s core component 
            is its relay chain, which allows the interoperability of varying networks. It also allows for 
            parachains, or parallel blockchains with their own native tokens for specific-use cases.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Where Polkadot differs from Ethereum is that rather than creating just dApps on Polkadot, developers can
            create their own blockchain while also using the security that Polkadot’s chain already has. With
            Ethereum, developers can create new blockchains but need to create their own security measures, 
            which can leave new and smaller projects open to attack because the larger a blockchain, 
            the more security it has. This concept in Polkadot is known as shared security.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, another member of the core founders of the Ethereum project who had
            differing opinions about the project’s future.

    [$const.ETC]: <div>
        <p>
            Ethereum Classic (ETC) is an open-source, decentralized, blockchain-based distributed cryptocurrency 
            platform that runs smart contracts. Ethereum Classic was formed in 2016 as a result of a hack of The 
            DAO, a smart contract operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The original blockchain was split in two, 
            with the majority of users choosing to reverse the hack and return the stolen funds.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The split revealed philosophical divisions within the Ethereum community. Based on the principle that
            “Code is Law,” a small number of developers and miners believed that The DAO's investors should 
            suffer the consequences of investing in a flawed project. However, the majority of the 
            Ethereum community decided to roll back the blockchain, effectively creating a bailout for 
            The DAO's investors. Ethereum Classic is the name of the original, smaller blockchain.
        </p>
    </div>,

    [$const.ETH]: <div>
        <p>
            Ethereum (ETH) is both a cryptocurrency and a decentralized computing platform. 
            Developers can use the platform to create decentralized applications 
            and issue new crypto assets known as Ethereum tokens.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin and other coins. But Ether is 
            much more than just a blockchain-platform, which performs a 
            direct function of currency services. It's a complex system 
            of smart contracts, the idea of which is to combine completely 
            different areas and improve processes, optimize routine operations.
        </p>
        <ul className='pl-[25px] list-disc'>
            <li>
                Smart contracts are algorithms in the network that track if-then type operations. 
                They oversee the compliance of all parties with the terms of the transaction 
                (performing actions, transferring money, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
                Smart contracts eliminate the need for an intermediary, which increases speed, 
                increases safety, and reduces the costs of transaction processing.

            Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency created from a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain in 2011. It was
            initially designed to address the developer's concerns that Bitcoin was becoming too centrally 
            controlled, and to make it more difficult for largescale mining firms to gain the upper hand in mining.
            While eventually unsuccessful in preventing enterprise miners from taking over the lion's share of 
            Litecoin mining, the cryptocurrency has reworked itself into a minable coin and a peer-to-peer payment system.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It shares similar features with Bitcoin but has a different algorithm. The cryptocurrency's goal is to
            become a medium for daily transactions.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Litecoin has a faster transaction processing time compared to Bitcoin.

    [$const.MANA]: <div>
        <p>
            Decentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that
            allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and
            monetize.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Decentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering (ICO) that was conducted in
            2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020.
            Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including
            interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire
            non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables,
            names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.

    [$const.NEAR]: <div>
        <p>
            NEAR Protocol is a layer-one blockchain that was designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and
            that eliminates some of the limitations that have been bogging competing blockchains, such as low
            transaction speeds, low throughput and poor interoperability. This provides the ideal environment for
            DApps and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account
            names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to Ethereum. NEAR also introduces unique solutions 
            to scaling problems and has its own consensus mechanism called “Doomslug.”
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            NEAR Protocol is being built by the NEAR Collective, its community that is updating the initial code and
            releasing updates to the ecosystem. Its declared goal is to build a platform that is “secure enough to
            manage high value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday
            people.”
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Flux, a protocol that allows developers to create markets based on assets, commodities, real-world
            events, and Mintbase, an NFT minting platform are examples of projects being built on NEAR Protocol.
