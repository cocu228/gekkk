The primary purpose of Synthetix is to be used for the creation of synthetic assets, also known as “synths”—a combination of assets having the same value as another asset. The synths may track and provide a return on another asset without requiring anyone to hold that asset. In simpler words, Synthetix cryptocurrency provides exposure to a wide variety of crypto as well as non-crypto assets in a decentralized and permissionless manner. It enables users to participate in the DeFi ecosystem despite not holding the assets.",

For doing so, synths use smart-contract-based price discovery protocols, known as oracles, that permit users to hold and exchange the underlying assets. Smart contracts are just like regular contracts; however, instead of being drafted on paper, these contracts run in the form of protocols on the blockchain. They are used to automate a workflow and trigger the forthcoming actions when the conditions are met. In this way, Synthetix aims to allow users to efficiently trade synth assets without facing liquidity issues.

ZKPs ensure that assets are always in the control of users.",
      "trading": "The majority of crypto trading takes place on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, which are online platforms run by private corporations that hold users’ funds and match trading orders. However, as indicated in the whitepaper, these platforms come with a variety of risks. The three main risks of centralized exchanges include lack of security, lack of transparency, and lack of liquidity. As a result, a new type of exchange called decentralized exchange has evolved to address these issues. These exchanges are different from centralized exchanges because users keep control of their private keys by trading directly on the underlying blockchain. However, decentralized exchanges are not completely free from flaws. Performance and structural constraints continue to be a problem.",
      "purpose": "Hence, Loopring’s stated purpose is to create a hybrid platform that combines prominent features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The protocol aims to maintain the benefits of decentralized exchanges while lowering or eliminating their inefficiencies through hybrid solutions. Loopring intends to improve order execution efficiency and DEX liquidity by managing the orders in a centralized manner but settling the trade on blockchain.",
      "seeks": "Another prominent feature that Loopring seeks to offer is the low transaction cost. Loopring aims to execute the majority of operations, such as trade and transfer settlement, off the Ethereum blockchain. This considerably reduces the gas usage and overall transaction cost to a fraction of what it would be on-chain."

      "hybrid": "IDEX is a hybrid liquidity decentralized exchange (DEX) that combines a high-performance orderbook and matching engine with an automated market maker (AMM). Orderbook refers to a list of orders for a specific asset organized by price level. The platform blends the advantages of centralized and decentralized exchanges with the performance and characteristics of a traditional orderbook and the liquidity and security of an AMM. IDEX permits traders to obtain the best practices, prevent failed transactions, while providing liquidity, all with the power of actual limit and stop-loss orders. IDEX operates on the Polygon blockchain, supporting MATIC and ERC-20 assets.",
      "aspects": "The three important aspects of the platform are high-performance exchange, hybrid liquidity, and smart contracts. The high-performance exchange component is analogous to that on top of centralized exchanges. This design allows IDEX to match centralized exchanges in latency and performance that are unavailable from other DEXs.Further, the IDEX Hybrid Liquidity (IDEX HL) incorporates a traditional orderbook and matching engine with AMM liquidity pools. So, traders are seamlessly matched against the most suitable combination of limit orders and pool liquidity for low-cost execution without any additional efforts. IDEX HL relies on smart contracts to handle security and trade settlement, enforcing the constraints of the AMM pricing curve and enabling users to manage custody of their assets.",
      "contract": "Next, the IDEX smart contract contains three settlement processes employed in various circumstances depending on the type of liquidity being matched. The IDEX smart contracts bring programmatic guarantees to the platform. So, IDEX utilizes a series of smart contracts to decentralize fund custody and trade settlement by introducing such novel DeFi mechanisms.",
      "economics": "About the economics of the token, the IDEX token aligns rewards between the exchange and IDEX token stakers who play a vital role in the operations of IDEX. Stakers are rewarded with half (50%) of the trade fees for their participation.",
      "record": "Stakingnodes keep a real-time record of system data. This reduces the IDEX's operational cost by offloading popular API (application programming interface) operations. Staking nodes are evaluated by their uptime to determine their performance. Uptime is a function of API performance and online sessions.",
      "placed": "IDEX tokens should be placed as collateral to act as nodes and receive payment for node operations. In the event of serving incorrect data, the respective node address will be blacklisted, and the operator must re-incubate their tokens. IDEX staking allows for “riskless” staking from cold storage as no slashing mechanism is involved."

The Serum is based on Solana and is fully permissionless. Websites or applications that use Serum's protocol may adjust the experience to their target market's use case and compliance requirements.",
      "offers": "Serum offers a completely on-chain order book, allowing trading interfaces and other applications to 'plug into' Serum's modular ecosystem. The flexibility to determine the price, size, and direction of their transaction is claimed as a unique feature of this exchange mechanism for users. Serum DEX, built on top of the Asset Agnostic Order book, gives the ecosystem a larger pool of liquidity and a shared resource to support trading functionality. Permissioned marketplaces provide much more freedom and conformity.",

This allows Mirror Protocol to track the price of stocks, futures, exchange-traded funds, and other traditional financial assets and bridges cryptocurrency markets with traditional markets. MIR is the governance token of Mirror Protocol and is used for governance, CDP closure fees, and liquidity mining.",
      "access": "This is intended to offer greater access to the US equities market through the minting of synthetic assets. These Mirrored Assets (mAssets) mirror the price behavior of the real-world assets and reflect the exchange prices on-chain. The decentralized representation grants traders price exposure to assets that would otherwise be inaccessible. These mAssets gather their price from decentralized oracles at thirty-second intervals.",
      "blockchain": "Mirror Protocol works on the Terra blockchain and is available on Ethereum via the Shuttle-bridge. These platforms allow every asset to be represented on the blockchain.",
      "token": "The native token for Mirror Protocol is the Mirror Token (MIR). This token is used for governance, staking, and rewards, and the token has a total supply of 370 million, which should drop over a period of four years. MIR is inflationary in nature and is expected to have new uses as the token matures."

      "technology": "BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer distributed communication technology that allows huge, in-demand data distribution. The protocol eliminates the need for maintaining a central server.The BitTorrent protocol allows software endpoints (called 'clients') to work together to ensure reliable simultaneous distribution of huge files to several clients, reducing dependency on any weak point (such as a server connection). The protocol strives to maximize the utilization of each client's upload and download bandwidth to balance peer-to-peer content delivery across all clients.",
      "portion": "How the Protocol Works: Peers can find a file or a portion of a file by making an 'announcement' to a tracker, which is a server that tracks which peers have access to which files, or by searching the DHT, a distributed database of peers. This process organically splits peers into 'swarms' of users, with each swarm sharing a common interest in trading portions of a certain file.",
      "occurs": "Files are cut into fragments before an exchange occurs. Clients advertise which parts of a file are available to their users; then, users who have the required parts post them, which in turn allows users who require these parts to download them. Cryptographichashes (i.e. info hashes) of the parts/pieces are used to ensure that the parts shared are indeed the ones requested.",
      "pieces": "The more pieces a peer receives in exchange for pieces provided, the more productive a peer-to-peer contact is perceived to be. Clients with the most productive exchanges are rewarded with additional pieces, while those with the least productive exchanges are disconnected or banned.",
      "allow": "After completing a download, a user can allow their client to continue uploading parts despite no longer requiring a download; this is known as 'seeding.' Most clients' default behavior is to 'seed' to other downloaders. This behavior is completely selfless and voluntary. There is no financial penalty for customers who close their BitTorrent software once a download is completed.",
      "directly": "The platform wants app developers to directly reward consumers who provide its underlying resources by allowing consumers to use this 'found value' to transact with publishers and app developers without using traditional currency.The company intends to enhance the BitTorrent protocol and establish a new token, BTT, to implement a distributed infrastructure services economy. End users in the BTT economy should be able to supply infrastructure services in small amounts in exchange for tokens.",
      "cryptographic": "BTT is a TRON TRC-10 cryptographic token. BTT seeks to act as a general-purpose mechanism for transferring computer resources between BitTorrent clients and a market of service requesters and providers."

      "introduces": "The Filecoin protocol introduces a decentralized storage network (DSN) based on blockchain. As claimed by the whitepaper, with the DSN scheme, multiple independent storage providers offer data storage and data retrieval to clients on the Filecoin network. In other words, the Filecoin DSN handles storage and retrieval requests via two verifiable markets, i.e., the Storage Market and the Retrieval Market, respectively. The two markets have the same structure but different design.",
      "clients": "The Storage Market allows clients to pay storage miners to store data. The storage market is a verifiable market through which clients (buyers) place matching orders with storage miners (sellers). Once matched, orders are submitted to the orderbook (sets of orders). That way, the public gets access to all the orders recorded on the Filecoin blockchain. Additionally, both clients and storage miners must pledge and commit to their resources, where storage miners provide constant proof of storage for an order.",
      "data": "The Retrieval Market allows clients to retrieve data by paying retrieval miners to deliver the data. In the Retrieval Market, clients can request retrieval of a specific piece from an order. Retrieval miners obtain pieces from the Retrieval Market or by storing them from being a storage miner. Participants in the retrieval market follow an off-chain process of exchanging pieces and settling prices. Therefore, Retrieval Miners and clients exchange data without the network knowing about it. Mostly, the retrieval miner splits the data into multiple parts, and the client pays for each part that is retrieved.",
